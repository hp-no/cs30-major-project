## Beta testing
Constructive feedback + suggestions gathered from beta-testers.

## Gerlie
- Add an option to change the background colour
- "Preview" mode, involving automatic rotation of object
- Tool icons are bit confusing as they don't have much practical use

## Katharine
- Adjust painting tool to not paint through the blocks behind the intended block (cube)
- Adjust sculpting tool to not sculpt through multiple blocks all at once (cube)
- Circle indicators underneath tool icons might be unnecessary

## Paulie
- Potentially add an undo function
