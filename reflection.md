# Reflection

## Advice to self if I did this project again:
I would probably shorten the time I spent looking into different methods for a 3D program, and put more of that time into learning the three.js docs to have gotten a better feel for the functions and code. If I did this project again, I might just avoid using 3D elements or least not have the project be based so heavily on the 3D plane. Working and getting used to the nuances of working in 3D has been kind of a nightmare, and I think I could've done more or made faster progress had I made the program just a bit less reliant on the 3D aspect.

## Most difficult part of the project:

Learning and getting used to the three.js library whilst using it alongside p5.js. I took a considerable amount of time in the beginning of the project to figure out how I could incorporate the art mechanics I wanted to do in a 3D plane. I had been looking at multiple methods to use 3D alongside my code, and ended up using three.js. The process of learning the library and its nuances initially made writing code slow and tricky in getting it to work, especially when learning how to use raycasting and mouse detection in a 3D setting, which had been incredibly confusing but rewarding to have incorporated in my code.

## Status of the Needs to Have List:
There are some parts of my Needs to Have List that ended up being a bit different from what was initally intended, such as "the use of 3D models", as I found it was much more effective to just create shapes/models within the code rather than importing it from elsewhere.

## What I am most proud of:
I am most proud of the sculpting/painting mechanic in my project. It took a lot of trial and error to both figure out and get it to work how I wanted it to work. Raycasting and mouse detection for the objects had already been confusing for me, but figuring how to make these two functions work without affecting the blocks behind them stumped me for a while. I think it's because of how frustrating it was to incorporate and understand, that it felt the most rewarding to complete and have working.
