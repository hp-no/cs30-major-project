# Reflection

## Advice to self if I did this project again:
I would probably cut the time in learning three.js in half so I could put more time into coding, or just avoid making the project in 3D altogether. Working with 3D has been kind of a nightmare, and I think I could've gone farther and made more progress quicker if I had stuck to the 2D plane.

## Most difficult part of the project:

Learning and getting used to the three.js library whilst using it alongside p5.js. I took a considerable amount of time in the beginning of the project to figure out how I could incorporate the art mechanics I wanted to do in a 3D plane. I had been looking at multiple methods to use 3D alongside my code, and ended up using three.js. The process of learning the library and its nuances initially made writing code slow and tricky in getting it to work, especially when learning how to use raycasting and mouse detection in a 3D setting, which had been incredibly confusing but rewarding to have incorporated in my code.

## Status of the Needs to Have List:
There are some parts of my Needs to Have List that ended up being a bit different from what was initally intended, such as "the use of 3D models", as I found it was much more effective to just create shapes/models within the code rather than importing it from elsewhere.

## What I am most proud of:
I am most proud of the sculpting/painting mechanic in my project. It took a lot of trial and error to both figure out and get it to work how I wanted it to work. Raycasting and mouse detection for the objects had already been confusing for me, but figuring how to make these two functions work without affecting the blocks behind them stumped me for a while. I think it's because of how frustrating it was to incorporate and understand, that it felt the most rewarding to complete and have working.
